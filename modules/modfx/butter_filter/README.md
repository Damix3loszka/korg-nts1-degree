Modulation effect module containing a Butterworth filter with variable cutoff frequency and variable order in lowpass and highpass mode.

Transfer function was derived using bilinear transformation.

### Controls
| Knob | Function         |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| A    | Cutoff frequency |
| B    | Order and mode   |

Filter mode is selected by turning B knob to the left for lowpass mode and right for highpass mode. Orders are selected by the degree of rotation to either side (e.g. turning B knob all the way to the left will select 3rd order lowpass mode).
